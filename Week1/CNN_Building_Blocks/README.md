# Week 1: Working with images & CNN Building Blocks

1. Working with Images_Introduction
  - Looking at an image as a bunch of pixel values
  - Types of images – Greyscale, Binary, colour
  - Image formats – RAW, JPEG, PNG etc.
  - Displaying images in python environment using PIL and Matplotlib
2. Working with Images - Digitization, Sampling, and Quantization
  - Sampling and quantization of 1D and 2D continuous signals
  - Approximation of an arc in the digital space
  - Definition of a Picture
  - Resolution of a picture
3. Working with images - Filtering
  - Recap on what an image is
  - Domain and Range in the context of an image
  - Understanding a Histogram
  - Correlation and convolution of a dummy image grid with a kernel
  - Concept of Filtering with examples
4. Hands-on Python Demo: Working with images
  - Getting familiar with using an image in python
  - Building a simple Averaging Filter from scratch
5. Introduction to Convolutions
  - Convolutional Neural Network vs plain Neural Network
  - Need for Convolutional as an alternative to a plain neural network
  - Translational invariance
  - A simple demonstration of convolution using a 1D array
6. 2D convolutions for Images
  - Demonstration of convolution on a simple 2D image, using manual calculations Convolution - Forward
  - Demonstration of convolution using a dummy array, in tensorflow
